# SplashLearn Worksheets

Welcome to the SplashLearn Worksheets project! This project is designed to help educators and students pull together subject (e.g., math) worskheets to create an easy to use book for daily use. I used this with my kid to help her spend 30 mins per day on a given topic. I printed the consolidated book so I could avoid screen time. 

Note: I have a paid SplashLearn subscription. I suggest you get your subscription as well before you use this even though this script doesn not use the subscription
